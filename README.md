# My React app

This is my attempt at making a React application consuming a [{JSON} Placeholder API][1].

I managed to create both class components ([PostCreate.js][postcreate]) using state and functional components ([PostList.js][postlist]) using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

[postcreate]: src/components/posts/PostCreate.js
[postlist]: ./components/posts/PostList.js
